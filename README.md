In this repository, you will find a selection of Leetcode problems that I have solved. Along the way of completing Leetcode 75 I decided that I was going to document my leetcode journey. 

There are 4 folders that contain the leetcode problems that I have completed:

Neetcode 308: All the problems in neetcode 434 I have completed so far (currently around 200) (it is called neetcode 308 because there was only 308 problems at the time on neetcode)

Contest: All the problems that I have completed during leetcode contests

Mediums: All of the random medium problems that I have completed on leetcode

Hards: All of the random hard problems that I have completed on leetcode
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

In each file, you will find the actual problem with either my approach, puesdocode, or even both at the top, followed by the implementation of the solution with inline comments to help clarify the code. Sometimes if I feel like a solution is very easily understandable I will only put inline comments
